- [bedrock-runtime CLI commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/bedrock-runtime/): be aware that this is one of the very few CLI implementations that is omitting some of the API actions. The *Stream are missing (probably because it is hard to consume streams in a shell, and the usefulness of such scenario is limited)
